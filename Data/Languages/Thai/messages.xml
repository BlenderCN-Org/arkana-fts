Unfortunately, all these new things can't be tryed out by you right now, as we do not have a master-server! It is too expensive for us and we didn't find someone that is ready to host our server application yet. If you own a server and want to help us, please contact us!"/>
  <Info value="This is a christmas release of Arkana-FTS: a release to show you what progress we have made, to let you play around.
There are a few features not working, especially the online gaming (as we lack a server) and the model viewer (as we are rewriting the model format).
We hope you enjoy playing around with Arkana-FTS anyways.

From now on, we will give our best to have one release every 1 or 2 months

The team wishes you a lot of fun, a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
