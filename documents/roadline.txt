NOTE: this is a long-term roadline and it is not a strict order !
that means things from version 0.5 can be done before everything from version 0.4 is done !

Version 0.1:
------------
	- Fully support the 3D Model files with animations using OpenGL.
	- Have a first (temporary ?) menu working and using LUA scripts combined with CEGUI.
	- Being able to set all the current options in a nice in-game options dialog.
	- Finish and display the Pompei2 demo.

Version 0.2:
------------
	- Complete the new game menu.
	- Load a map (that the user chose before) and display it.
	- Display some objects (units, buildings) on the map.

Version 0.3:
------------
	- Be able to select these objects.
	- Implement actions on selected objects (like walk, attack, build, train, ...)

Version 0.4:
------------
	- Add some nice 3D rendering special effects (maybe an intro demo ?)
	- Create the first campaign (with LUA scripting ?)

Version 0.4.5:
--------------
	- Begin two new projects: FTS Map Editor and FTS Campaign Creator

--- A LOT OF VERSIONS ---

Version 1.0:
------------
	- Have a fully working game with multiplayer, campaigns, editor, ... everything !
	! I think that's why there will never be a version 1.0: I'll aways find something to add :)
