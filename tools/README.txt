How to use these tools?

ftsarc:
=======
This tool creates arkana-fts archive files (something like a zip or rar file).

Just drag&drop a file or a set of files or a directory onto the exe file and an
archive file named "out.ftsarc" will be created.

To extract an archive, just drag&drop it onto the exe and it will be extracted.

devs_map_builder:
=================
THIS PROGRAM IS A TEMPORARY SOLUTION. This program helps us create terrains until we
have a real map editor with WYSIWYG 3D map editing. It's better than using a hex editor.

For now, you'll have to start the exe in the directory where the map configuration files
are located (so move it there first), example files are given in the Samplemap directory.

For a better explanation of what is what, refer to our wiki, or just ask us.

ftsblends:
==========
This creates blend tiles, you really don't need this. Call it from within the console to
see what parameters it wants. (width, height, noise)
