                              INSTALL FOR LINUX
                              -----------------


 Requirements
--------------

  The following libraries and applications are NECESSARY to compile Arkana-FTS:
    * CMake version 2.4 or above
    * A threading library like pthreads (libpthreads) - For the threads
    * The SDL library (libSDL) - For the windows
    * OpenGL, OpenGL Utilities (libGL, libGLU) - For the 3D stuff

  It is known to compile in GCC 4.4 and 4.6.
  GCC 4.5 has known bugs and won't compile.

  The following 3rd party libraries will be compiled if they are not found on your system:
    * The OpenAL software and OpenAl Utility Toolkit library (libopenal-soft) - For the sound
    * The Ogg and Vorbis libraries (libogg, libvorbis) - For compressed music files
    * A modified version of CEGUI 0.5, along with:
          o PCRE (libpcre)
          o The FreeType library (libfreetype)
    * A modified version of Cal3D
    * The DaoVM - For the scripting language.

 How to compile Arkana-FTS: the easy way
-----------------------------------------

  The most easy way to install Arkana-FTS is to call the build script:
    > sh build.sh
  And if you have all necessary librarys installed, everything will be
  done automatically. After the installation, you will have the fts executable
  in the fts directory and can just run it
    > ./fts
  and enjoy the game. For more options, see "Advanced Options" below.

 How to compile Arkana-FTS: the longer way
-------------------------------------------

  Change into the directory "linux", by typing
    > cd linux
  There you must call CMake to check your system and create the Makefiles
    > cmake ..
  Or to enable debug mode you call CMake like this
    > cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug ..
  If everything went fine, you should now have a Makefile in your directory
  and thus be able to run make
    > make
  If everything went fine, you should have an executable called "fts"
  in the "build" directory. Copy it over one directory back using
    > cp fts ..
  And go back to run fts
    > cd ..
    > ./fts

  Enjoy the game.

 Advanced Options
------------------

  Debug mode:
  - - - - - -

    The first possible fine-tuning option you can do is compile Arkana-FTS in
    debug mode. To do this, you just need to call the build script with
    the '-d' switch turned on
      > sh build.sh -d
    And Arkana-FTS will be compiled in debug mode.

    Note that it will run (much) slower in debug mode then in release mode.
    Debug mode should be used only for developpers.

    Also note that the '-d' (debug, see below) switch is only needed during the
    configure step. If you activate the '-n' switch, there is no need to
    activate the '-d' switch aswell.

  Make clean:
  - - - - - -

    If you need some disk space or you just want to rebuild everything because
    I-don't-know-what-a-b*sh*t-happened, you can run something like a 'make clean'
    by calling the build script with the '-c' switch turned on
      > sh build.sh -c
    And all object files, configure caches and whatsoever will be deleted.
